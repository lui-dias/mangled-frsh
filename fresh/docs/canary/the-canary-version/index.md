  Learn more about Fresh canary releases
---

The canary version represents the current development state of Fresh. It's
intended for testing work in progress features before it lands in a stable
release. Whenever new code is merged into the `main` branch on
[GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/fresh) a new canary version is created that
matches the hash of the git commit.

With the addition of new features that are not yet in a stable release, we need
a place to update our documentation. That's what this section of the
documentation is about. It contains all information about unreleased features
and changes that will land in a stable release.
